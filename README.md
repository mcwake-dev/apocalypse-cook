# Apocalypse Cook

A very much WIP project to build a HTML, CSS and React-based game to demonstrate my abilities with these technologies in a way that's a lot more interesting for a recruiter to look at that yet another Todo app or something written by ChatGPT.

## Setting
In the game, you will travel around local settlements in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, trading ingredients and cooking tasty meals for the inhabitants. As the inhabitants become healthier, the wasteland will be healed and new ingredients will be made available.

## How to Run
Presently this is purely a client-side application with no ability to save and no multiplayer capability, although I would definitely like to add this at some point.

1) Clone the repository
```
   git clone https://github.com/mcwake-dev/apocalypse-cook
```
2) CD into the cloned repo
```
   cd apocalypse-cook
```
3) NPM install
```
   npm i
```
4) Run (development mode)
```
   npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used
* Vite
